Garbage Collector
-Mark,Sweep,Compacting(Cause pause of application for few seconds)
Division of Heap
Young Generation
-Eden
-Survivor from(counter for no of cycke it survives)
-Survivor to
Old Generation

Types of GC
1- Serial Collector (single thread)
2- Concurrent Collector (along with the application, pauses only for mark and re-mark)
	When to use?
	-more memory
	-high number of CPUs
	-application demands short pauses
3- Parallel Collector (uses multiple CPUs, waits until the heap fills and then kicks in)
	When to use?
	-There is lesser memory
	-There is lesser number of CPUs
	-Application demands high throughtput and can withstand pauses
4- G1 GC-(Garbage first)(parallel + concurrent)
	Divides heaps into smaller regions. Where there is more garbage
	it gets collected
	-Low pauses with fragmentation
	-Parallel and concurrent together
	-Better heap utilization
