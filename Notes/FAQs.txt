==>Difference between sleep, yeild, wait?
* wait() method releases the acquired lock when the thread is waiting till some other threads calls notify. While sleep(sleepTime) method keeps the lock even if the thread is waiting.
* wait() can only be called from the synchronized context otherwise
it will throw IlligalMonitorStateException. while sleep() can be called from any state block.
* wait is called on Object while sleep is called on Thread.
* waiting thread can be awaken by calling nofify/notifyAll method
while sleep cannot be awaken(though it can be interrupted).

*yeild method pauses the currently executing thread temporarily
for giving chance to remaining thread of same priority to execute.
If there is no waiting thread, or all other threads have lower
priority then same thread will continue its execution.
